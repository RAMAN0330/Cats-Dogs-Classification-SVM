# Cats-Dogs-Classification-SVM

This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle dataset. The goal is to build a model that can accurately distinguish between images of cats and dogs.


## Introduction

The Cats-Dogs-Classification-SVM project aims to leverage Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for image classification. By training on a labeled dataset of cat and dog images, the SVM model learns to identify key features that distinguish the two classes.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- Implementation of SVM using scikit-learn
- Model training and evaluation
- Support for custom datasets
- Visualization of results

## Data Description

The dataset used for this project is sourced from the Kaggle dataset [Dogs vs. Cats](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data). The dataset contains images of cats and dogs in separate folders.

### Sample Data

The dataset consists of two main folders:
- `train`: Contains 25,000 images of cats and dogs for training.
- `test`: Contains 12,500 images of cats and dogs for testing.
